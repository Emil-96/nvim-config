# My Neovim Config

My personal Neovim setup with LSP, Treesitter and focus on Go development support.

## Setup

Just run `./setup.sh`, it will install everything.

## Additional steps

The setup assumes a nerd font already installed. If not, download one [from here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and set it as the terminal font.
